O RLY Comment Spam Search creates a quick link to make sure comments aren't spam.

== Description ==

Comment spam is annoying, and although there are great plugins like Akismet 
to catch spam, annoying "this is best post evar" compliment spam seems to
always wiggle through.  The best way to tell if a compliment is genuine
is to check Google to see if it's been slathered all over the web.

Auto-querying Google is against the ToS, so this plugin just gives you 
convenient link to do the check.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `o-rly.php` to the `/wp-content/o-rly-comment-spam-search/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Enjoy!
